## Introduction

DStack was created to bring together some of the popular libraries/technologies for the decentralized web (like [IPFS](https://ipfs.io)) into a single ecosystem to provide an easy way for developing decentralized web applications where your infrastructure is a single source of truth.

For example, you can use PubSub API to create real-time events client-side

or Shard API to share temporary/preview files or structured data between clients without the need to upload to your servers

For example, you can create a collaborative real-time WYSIWYG editor with file preview support where all events and file previews are handled without your server infrastructure.

## What DStack offers

DStack simplifies IPFS JavaScript API for application development usage

DStack provides:

- [Store](/docs/store) API
- [Shard](/docs/shard) API
- [PubSub](/docs/pubsub) API
- [Relay](https://github.com/dstack-js/dstack/tree/main/packages/relay)
