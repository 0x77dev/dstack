# @dstack-js/transport

Forked from [libp2p-webrtc-star](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-webrtc-star/tree/v0.17.x) to add ability to isolate peers by namespacing them.

This module is optimized to work with [DStack Relay](https://dstack.dev/docs/relay)

And this module was made specifically to use in [@dstack-js/ipfs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dstack-js/ipfs) package.

[See tutorial to get started working with DStack](https://dstack.dev/docs/intro)
