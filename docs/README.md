# DStack

## Introduction

DStack was created to bring together some of the popular libraries for the decentralized web into a single ecosystem

## What DStack offers

Currently DStack provides only distributed graph database built on top of [Gun.js](https://gun.eco)

In planned [release `v0.1.0`](https://github.com/0x77dev/dstack/milestone/1) DStack will offer distributed/hosted file sharing, user authentication, encryption and streams support

## DStack uses

You can build distributed web/electron/react-native applications, that will not rely on backend implementation and cannot be controlled by big corporations
