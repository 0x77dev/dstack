_DStack is under heavy development, currently some docs is not finished yet_

Let's discover **DStack in less than 15 minutes**.

### Introduction

DStack was created to bring together some of the popular libraries/technologies for the decentralized web (like [IPFS](https://ipfs.io)) into a single ecosystem to provide an easy way for developing decentralized web applications where your infrastructure is a single source of truth.

For example, you can use PubSub API to create real-time events client-side

or Shard API to share temporary/preview files or structured data between clients without the need to upload to your servers

For example, you can create a collaborative real-time WYSIWYG editor with file preview support where all events and file previews are handled without your server infrastructure.

## Play with DStack in browser console

https://explorer.dstack.dev/

## Add DStack to your project

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```shell
yarn add @dstack-js/lib
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

```shell
npm i -S @dstack-js/lib
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Initialize Stack

```javascript
import { Stack } from '@dstack-js/lib';
// In non-browser environment you need to provide WebRTC implementation
// import wrtc from '@dstack-js/wrtc';
// const stack = await Stack.create({ namespace: 'namespace', wrtc });
const stack = await Stack.create({ namespace: 'namespace' });

console.log('My Peer ID is:', stack.id);
```

### Interact with PubSub

```javascript
stack.pubsub.subscribe('topic', (msg) => {
  console.log('Received a message', msg.from, msg.data);
});

stack.pubsub.publish('topic', 'Hello, DStack!');
```

### Interact with Store

```javascript
// Set value
const shard = await Shard.new(stack, ShardKind.Object, {hello: 'world'})
await stack.store.set('hello', shard));

// Get value
const shard = await stack.store.get('hello');
```
