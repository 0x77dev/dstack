## Cloud

We are announcing DStack Cloud ðŸ›°

During next quarter we will release cloud, a hosting solution to provide you an ability to cache your Store/Shards on the edge, have isolated relay for your application and observe your semi-decentralized infrastructure powered by DStack

Also when cloud will be released, unknown namespaces in public relay will be limited by 10 peers by default

The pricing and plans will be announced when released, but don't worry, we will offer a free plan for hobby projects

## Beta release

We announcing a beta release by the end of 2022 Q2

It will include major improvements to our core library to provide more fluent developing experience and improve bundle size

Also probably it will include major testing in production projects

We are searching for projects who are interested to use DStack in production to collect feedback, bug reports and feature requests, [you can apply here](https://6l3fibt6mac.typeform.com/to/NZL0qDN2)

## Relay

We are announcing [99% uptime](https://uptime.is/99) milestone in Public Relay

[Public Relay](/docs/relay#public-relay) now has a new multi-regional and highly available deployment on the edge powered by [fly.io](https://fly.io)

Also you can check it's availability and incidents on [status page](https://status.dstack.dev) or [report a downtime](https://github.com/dstack-js/dstack/issues/new/choose)

## Peer isolation

Relay and Core library now supports peers isolation by namespacing them

It was achieved by forking [`libp2p-webrtc-star`](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-webrtc-star/tree/v0.17.x) into new module `@dstack-js/transport` to support custom communications between relay and libp2p to tell relay a namespace by which peers is isolated

## Core library

Now `@dstack-js/lib` includes IPFS and Relay GraphQL API communications out of the box, no need to manually request relay for bootstrap data

Also DStack now has a fork of [node-webrtc](https://github.com/corwin-of-amber/node-webrtc) to provide pre-built binaries for darwin arm64 (macOS on M1)
